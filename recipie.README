Combine all ingredients, 
stirring to dissolve sugar completely.
 Fill cylinder of ice cream maker no more than two-thirds full;
  freeze according to manufacturer's directions.
   (Refrigerate any remaining mixture until ready to freeze.) 
   Serve immediately or store in covered containers in freezer.


    I used 2 1/2 cups each of whipping cream and 1/2 & 1/2.
     Then took 1 cup milk and heated it to dissolve the sugar better,
      then chilled it before mixing everything
